### What is Vibe Coding Community?

**Vibe Coding Community** is a space where useful tools, best practices, and successful projects created with Vibe Coding are gathered and discussed. It’s a community where members share knowledge and experience with each other.

- **VCC Education** – a tribe dedicated to creating educational materials on Vibe Coding, including courses, webinars, and training sessions. We systematize everything discussed in the VCC Community and turn it into high-quality courses!
- **VCC Agency** – an agency that develops AI-powered products under the guidance of experienced professionals trained at VCC Education. We make custom development accessible to small and medium-sized businesses, reducing both product creation time and costs.
- **VCC Crypto** – a tribe that supports open-source projects and rewards participants with VCC cryptocurrency. If you’re a project author, you’ll earn VCC for every git clone of your project. If you’re a contributor, you’ll receive VCC for solving issues or improving the code through pull requests.

### Our Mission

We are building a future where software development becomes a harmonious symbiosis of human ingenuity and artificial intelligence. Our mission is to unite innovators to:
- Create a global community for sharing experiences, ideas, and best practices in AI-driven coding.
- Develop open-source solutions that make programming faster, more accessible, and more refined.
- Break down barriers between ideas and their realization by leveraging AI to reduce development costs.
- Train a new generation of coders capable of ensuring the quality of AI-generated code.
